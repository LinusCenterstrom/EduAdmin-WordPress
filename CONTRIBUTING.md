# How to contribute
If you feel that there's missing functionality in our plugin, feel free to help us out by extending the plugin.
Before you start coding away, please check our [issues](https://github.com/MultinetInteractive/EduAdmin-WordPress/issues), if there is already an issue about the thing you want to do.

We're using [PHP](https://php.net) and always focus on the latest version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.com)

## Getting started
- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com)
- Make sure you have access to a [EduAdmin-account](http://www.eduadmin.se) and the WordPress-API-key
- Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
- Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making changes
- Base your branch of our `master`-branch
- Make commits small and logical
- Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before commiting
- Make sure your commit messages are readable (Do not use the same format as the `autoDeploy`-branch)
  - You should reference the issue the commit is for

## Submitting the changes
- Push your changes to the branch you created in your own fork.
- Submit a pull request to our `master`-branch
